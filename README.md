Nashville Wage Growth vs. Cost of Living: Data Analytics Capstone
Project Overview
This capstone project analyzes how wages and the cost of living have changed in Nashville, Tennessee over the past decade. The main focus is to compare wage growth to the income needed to afford median housing and basic living expenses, highlighting the growing affordability gap for residents.

Data Sources
Zillow: Median rent and income needed for renters, 2015–2024

Metro Nashville: Average annual pay for metro government employees

U.S. Census Bureau (ACS): Median household income, Davidson County

MIT Living Wage Calculator: Living wage estimates for Davidson County

FRED (Federal Reserve): Consumer Price Index (CPI) for inflation trends

Key Questions
Are wages in Nashville keeping up with the rising cost of living and housing?

How has the income gap changed over time?

What role does inflation play in affordability?

Methods
Data collection via API, public CSV, and web scraping

Data cleaning and merging in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Analysis and visualization using Python, Power BI, and Excel

Main Findings
Income needed for rent has doubled since 2015, while wages have grown much more slowly.

The gap between actual pay and what’s needed for rent has widened sharply since 2021.

Inflation contributes, but rising housing costs are the main driver of reduced affordability.
